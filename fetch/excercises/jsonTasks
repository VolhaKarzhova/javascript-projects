Below are my answers to the excercises in JSON module:
1. Correct option is B.
{
   "type": "dog",
   "name": "Bernie",
   "age": 3
}
Option A is incorrect as it keys on JSON don not have double quotes.

Option C is incorrect as String values use single quotes instead of double quotes.

2. Option A is Correct
   Option B is incorrect, it shoudl have a key as a string for the list of objects.
   Option C is actually correct as well from JSON syntax perspective, I even checked it in Json Validator website.
   But not to have a key for the list of objects is a bad practice.
